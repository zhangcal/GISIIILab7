<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of CZGISIIILAB7FINAL is to create an R package. The plot() function in R doesn't really create good maps, so I create a leaflet substitute that can be used to quickly plot sf maps. The guest lecture just used base R to create a function fbind for its package, and it didn't go in depth into creating more complex functions that use other packages. My refinement on the guest lecture example is to include additional packages, namely, leaflet for plotting and the pipe operator. 

More specifically, given an sf polygon object, I create a function QuickMap() that plots the polygon shape of the sf object. `
